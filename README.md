# 👋 Hey there! I’m Stella
👩🏻‍💻 **Aspiring Software Engineer** | 📚 Former Quality Manager | 🎓 MSc in Computer Science

---

💻&nbsp;&nbsp;After over a decade in the education sector, I’ve made the leap into software engineering and I’m thrilled to build, code, and create solutions that make a difference!  
🌍&nbsp;&nbsp;With a BA in Linguistics and an MBA under my belt, I’m bringing a multidisciplinary approach to my tech journey.  
🐢&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently developed an end-to-end Android app to monitor sea turtle nesting in Greece for my MSc thesis (yes, I love nature too 🌱).

### Current Focus:
- Building clean, efficient code  
- Exploring full-stack development  
- Constantly learning and improving 🚀

💡 **Always up for project collaborations, new ideas, or just tech talk!**
